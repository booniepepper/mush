A file wasn't found for an out-of-line module.

Erroneous code example:

```
module file_that_doesnt_exist 
## error: file not found for module

main() {
    exit
}
```

Please be sure that a file corresponding to the module exists. If you
want to use a module named `file_that_doesnt_exist`, you need to have a file
named `file_that_doesnt_exist.sh` or `file_that_doesnt_exist/module.sh` in the
same directory.
